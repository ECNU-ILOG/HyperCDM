### Quick Start
We provide Math1 as sample datasets to validate the HyperCDM. You can reproduce the results by directly running `main.py`, i.e.
```
python main.py
```

### Run with other datasets
#### Step 1. prepare dataset
Refer to the sample dataset, you should prepare the following files:
```
â”œâ”€dataset
â”‚  â””â”€Your_dataset
â”‚          config.json
â”‚          data.csv   
â”‚          q.csv
```
Specifically, `config.json` records all necessary settings of dataset like the number of students, and the format of config.json is shown as following:
```
{
  "dataset": [String, the name of the dataset],
  "q_file": [string, the relative path of Q matrix],
  "data": [string, the relative path of response logs],
  "student_num": [int, the number of students],
  "exercise_num": [int, the number of exercises],
  "knowledge_num": [int, the number of knowledge concepts]
}
```

`data.csv` consists of response logs in the following format:
```
[int, student_id1],[int, question_id1],[0/1, response to question_id1]
[int, student_id1],[int, question_id2],[0/1, response to question_id2]
...
[int, student_idn],[int, question_idm],[0/1, response to question_idm]
```

`q.csv` contains the relevant between questions and knowledge attributes. Each entry in the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column means
whether the $i$-th question involves the $j$-th knowledge attributes.

#### Step 2. coding
Refer to the `main.py`, you can change the path to different configuration file.

#### Step 3. run code
```
python main.py
```

### Necessary Packages
```
pytorch 1.13.0+cu0.11
scikit-learn 1.1.2
pandas 1.3.2
scipy 1.9.1
```
