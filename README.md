## ðŸ“° News 
- [x] [2024.5.17] This work is accepted by KDD 2024 (20% acceptance rate) with the average score 5.5 out of 7.0.
- [x] [2024.4.8] We upload all datasets (including NeurIPS2020, EdNet-1, ASSISTment17 and Junyi) during the evaluation process, which can be used to reproduce the results of experiment.
- [x] [2024.2.2] We upload the source code of HyperCDM and metrics implementation.

## ðŸ’» Getting Started

### Quick Start
We provide Math1 as sample datasets to validate the HyperCDM. You can reproduce the results by directly running `main.py`, i.e.
```
python main.py
```
### File Tree

### Necessary Packages
```
pytorch 1.13.0+cu0.11
scikit-learn 1.1.2
pandas 1.3.2
scipy 1.9.1
```
